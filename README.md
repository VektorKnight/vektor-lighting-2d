# vektor-lighting-2d
 Ray-marched 2D lighting implementation in the Unity game engine.
 This project is very much a work in progress and should be used for reference only.
 
 ## Goals
 The primary goal of this project is a robust 2D lighting system akin to modern real-time ray-tracing but with sprites and other 2D objects.
 Performance is expected to be acceptable on most platforms with a modern GPU architecture.
